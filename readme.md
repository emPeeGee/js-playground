Encapsulation: Private and public members, closures.
Inheritance: Prototypal inheritance, class inheritance.
Polymorphism: Method overriding in JavaScript.
Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Module, etc.

8. Functional Programming (FP)
Immutability: How to achieve immutability in JavaScript (e.g., with Object.freeze).
Pure Functions: Definition and advantages.
Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take or return other functions (e.g., map, filter, reduce).

Composition: Composing multiple functions into one.

9. Testing
Unit Testing: Writing tests for individual functions or components.
Test Frameworks: Familiarity with Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, etc.
